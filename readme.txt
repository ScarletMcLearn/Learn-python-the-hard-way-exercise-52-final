Hello, this is my final project for Zed Shaw's 'Learn python the hard way'

*Notes*

1) You do not have to declare PYTHONPATH 

2) Running tests generate a lot of new session variables


*Things that work*

1) Login and score (username: user1, Password: password1 )

2) Ability to add more maps (just import new map and add it to tuple in app.py)

3) Tests (As mentioned they work but are super janky and badly written)

4) Shows available paths in each room

5) Fixed most if not all bugs given

6) Random number generators and limited tries for laser weapon armory (Using subclass in map.py)

7) Parser has been added to the map module's go() method


*Things that do not work*



1) Css not added yet

2) Score updates every time a wrong number is inserted in laser weapon armory
